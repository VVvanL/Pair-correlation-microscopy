# Pair correlation microscopy of intracellular molecular transport

The given code for Pair correlation microscopy is a source designed for researchers with an interest in quantitatively mapping the diffusive route a population of fluorescent proteins adopts with respect to live cell architecture with single-molecule resolution. The code was developed to promote and facilitate studies characterizing the directionality of intracellular transport, such as nucleocytoplasmic transport, and the diffusion law of a proteinâ€™s trafficking event, such as DNA target search. The intent is that the presented protocol simplifies the analysis and guides the interpretation of pair correlation microscopy-derived data. Improvements and open-source data will be continuously included to make the method more widely accessible and, with this, help increase the understanding of how intracellular diffusion regulates biological function at the single-molecule level.
